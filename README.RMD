This is an R Markdown document to describe the run_analysis.R which performs Data Cleaning and Tidying process on HAR Dataset which has been downloaded from:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

STEPS OF ANALYSIS
----------------------
The following steps were performed to generate the required tidy dataset


1. Download and store the dataset in working directory

2. Read each of the following data sets
  i. Features
  ii. activity.labels
  iii. Train
    a. xdata
    b. ydata
    c. subject data
  iv.  Test
    a. xdata
    b. ydata
    c. subject data
    

3. Merge train and test datasets as rowID, activity (ydata), all the columns from xdata
4. Merge train and test datasets in combined datasets and sort it based on rowID
5. Filter out the columns having mean and std in the column names and generate a new dataset
6. Final step is to group the dataset based on rowID and activity and summarize by calculating means.The following datasets are saved by this script

A Mean.csv

B Filtered.csv

C Train_Test_Combined.csv

D Test.csv

E Train.csv

The above datasets are produced for step-by-step testing purpose. The respective code can be commented out if they are not required.

The final output for the run_analysis.R is meanData.txt.

CHANGES REQUIRED IN THE CODE FOR PROCESSING
--------------------------------------------
A slight change is required in the script is the following code:
setwd("C:/Users/saurav/Documents/R/SmartPhoneData")

The above code is required to be changes to location where HAR dataset has been stored and unzipped. Also it is required to be ensured that directory/folder stucture has not been changed in the unzipped dataset because of assumptions made by the code in terms of the underlying folder structure to extract various required datasets.

STEPS TO EXECUTE THE CODE
-----------------------------
1. Store the HAR Dataset as per the current folder structure
2. Change the code as per above instruction - replace the folder path to where the HAR dataset has been stored and unzipped.
3. Run the code
4. meanData.txt will be produced in the same folder as HAR Dataset.
